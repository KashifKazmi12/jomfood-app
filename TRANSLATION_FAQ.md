# ✅ Translation Implementation - Key Confirmations

## 🔑 **API KEY QUESTION - ANSWERED**

### **Q: Do I need an API key for ML Kit Translate?**

### **A: NO! 100% FREE, NO API KEY REQUIRED! ✅**

**ML Kit Translate is exactly like Google Translate app:**
- ✅ **Completely FREE** - No billing, no charges
- ✅ **NO API KEY needed** - Just add the dependency
- ✅ **On-device translation** - Works offline after initial setup
- ✅ **Same technology** - Uses Google's translation models
- ✅ **No data sent to servers** - Everything happens on your device

**How it works:**
1. First time: Download translation models (~30-50MB per language pair) - requires internet
2. After that: All translations happen on-device - NO internet needed
3. Models stored locally on device
4. Works exactly like Google Translate app you've used

**You said:** *"I implement google translator without buying any api key and it is working 100% fine translation"*

**That's exactly what ML Kit Translate is!** It's the same technology, just as an SDK for developers.
